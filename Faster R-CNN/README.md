# Crowd-Counting

CROWD COUNTING



Introduction

This folder contains the code of for crowd counting performed on JHU dataset, mall dataset and sample of other images with respect to Fast R-CNN. 



Requirements

- tensorflow
- progressbar2
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cv2



Note

- Model must be downloaded and added to the "/data/utils/" folder. Link of the model: [Model link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14YzYPYbhV8tCwbYUa3LwTvGBtmq3Z_0d?usp=sharing)
- main_jhu.py and main_jhu.sh contains code to perform crowd counting on JHU dataset.
- main_mall.py and main_mall.sh contains code to perform crowd counting on Mall dataset.
- main_sample.py and main_sample.sh contains code to perform crowd counting on sample images.

- Results of JHU dataset is stored in jhu_output file, Mall dataset is stored in mall_output and sample images are stored in sample_results.

Run
- Run main_jhu.py, main_mall.py and main_sample.py to run this project.
- Files of format .sh were used to run the code on server hence address URL links (file location links has to be changed accordingly).
